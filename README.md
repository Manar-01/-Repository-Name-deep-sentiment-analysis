# Deep Sentiment Analysis  

This project implements **Deep Sentiment Analysis** using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Word Embeddings. The goal is to predict whether a movie review expresses a positive or negative sentiment. The project uses the IMDB movie review dataset, which contains 50,000 labeled reviews split equally between positive and negative sentiments.

## Features  

- **Dataset**: IMDB movie review dataset with 50,000 samples.  
- **Deep Learning Pipeline**:  
  - Use Keras's Embedding Layer to create word embeddings.  
  - Prepare and preprocess the dataset for NLP tasks.  
  - Train an RNN model for sentiment classification.  
- **Visualization**: Plot model training metrics such as accuracy and loss.

Description
Deep Sentiment Analysis with Recurrent Neural Networks

This repository demonstrates the integration of Deep Learning into Natural Language Processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis. Using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Keras's Embedding Layer, the project explores how word embeddings can capture semantic meaning and improve the accuracy of text classification tasks. The dataset used is the IMDB movie review dataset.
